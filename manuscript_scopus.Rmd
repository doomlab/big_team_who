abstract: |
  This paper will examine the nature of publications in Big Team Science (BTS) - large-scale collaborations between multiple researchers at multiple institutions. As interest in BTS increases, it is useful to explore who is currently involved in BTS projects to determine diversity in both research subject and researcher representation. The types of publication outlets, number of publications, and subject areas of publication will be presented to summarize the publications in BTS. Information about authors included in BTS will be presented including career length, numbers of publications/impact variables, education, and affiliation. Last, we will explore the representation of geopolitical regions by examining affiliation location to explore the impact of BTS on the de-WEIRD movement to diversify researcher representation.

According to the Oxford English dictionary, collaboration is two or more
people working together to achieve a certain goal [@oed2016].
Collaboration in scientific endeavors involves multiple researchers at
(potentially) multiple institutions to communicate and work together to
advance knowledge in their chosen field. Collaboration can manifest
uniquely in each project dependent on the skill sets, hypotheses, and
perspectives of collaborators. While collaboration is not new in
science, the current interest of "big team science" is increasing
[@forscher2020; @stewart2017; @coles2022]. Big team science projects
and/or organizations utilize and run on large-scale collaboration to
ensure that diverse populations and ideas are brought into research
projects, which in turn allows for more reliability and generalizability
in the results and method of the study. For this study, Big Team Science
(BTS) will be defined as a collaboration of ten or more authors from at
least ten different institutions.

BTS appears to be increasing as a result of two sources: 1) increasing
globalization and technology that allows for real-time interdisciplinary
research, and 2) increasing interest in reproducibility, replication,
and generalizability [@maxwell2015; @nelson2018; @zwaan2018].
Technological advances have provided easier ways to collaborate with
people who are from other universities and countries through document
sharing platforms (e.g., Google, GitHub, and the Open Science
Framework), video chatting platforms (e.g., Zoom, Microsoft Teams), and
messaging and project management platforms (e.g., Slack, Trello,
when2meet, etc.). The credibility movement seems to suggest that by
having both collaborations that span across the globe and subfield of
psychology, age groups, and education levels should help to drive
psychological science in the path of better materials, reliability,
generalizability and more robust sample size in a study
[@auspurg2021has; @nosek2014method; @lebel2018].

The credibility movement was originally defined by a focus on large
scale replications using in collaborative environments [@vazire2022].
Generally, the movement has been driven by early career researchers
(i.e., those who are within five years of their first appointment)
[@maizey2019]; however, there are no large meta-scientific
investigations on this specific topic to date. Potentially, the lack of
investigation is tied to the newness of the large-scale research in many
fields, as it is only in recent years that publications like the Open
Science Collaboration [@opensciencecollaboration2015], Many Labs
Collaborations [for example, @klein2018; @ebersole2020; @ebersole2016;
@klein2022; @mathur2020; @buttrick2020; @skorb2020] or the first papers
from the Psychological Science Accelerator [@moshontz2018; @jones2021;
@dorison2022; @wang2021; @legate2022; @bago2022]. Generally, the
researcher incentive for replication was low: journals often prioritize
"novel" or new results which led to rejection of replication manuscripts
and publication bias [@hubbard1997; @franco2014; @nosek2012], the
"failure" to replicate was often placed on the replication team as "bad
science" rather than a careful consideration of publication biases and
(potential) questionable research practices [@ioannidis2015;
@maxwell2015; @klein2022], and why should someone want to spend time and
resources on an answer we already "know" [@isager2021; @isager2021a]?

However, the success and interest in the large-scale reproducibility
projects [@opensciencecollaboration2015; @10.7554/eLife.71601], paired
with the meta-scientific publications focusing on researcher practices
and incentive structures [@silberzahn2018many; @john2012] led to a
change in journal guidelines and incentives for researchers interested
in participating in large-scale replication studies [@grahe2014;
@kidwell2016; @nosek2015; @mayo-wilson2021]. For example, the support
for Registered Reports, papers accepted before the data has been
collected [@nosek2014; @stewart2020], and entire sub-sections of
journals devoted to only replication studies (e.g., *Nature, Royal
Society Open Science, Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological
Science*) has allowed researchers to invest in projects that they know
should be published when the project is complete. Further, the
implementation of the Transparency and Openness Guidelines [@nosek2015]
and the Contributor Role Taxonomy (CRediT) system [@allen2019] have
pushed journals and researchers to promote more open, inclusive
publication practices.

The credibility movement has been mirrored by the calls for
diversification or de-WEIRDing (e.g., Western, Educated, Industrialized,
Rich, and Democratic) scientific research [@henrich2010; @newson2021;
@rad2018] by improving representation in research samples. Like the
large-scale studies in Physics [@aphilos2021; @castelnovo2018] and
Biology [@collins2003], the social sciences struggle to represent the
breadth of humanity across both researcher and population
characteristics. Now, grassroots organizations, such as the
Psychological Science Accelerator [@moshontz2018], ManyBabies
(<https://manybabies.github.io/>), NutNet (<https://nutnet.org/>), and
DRAGNet (<https://dragnetglobal.weebly.com/>) can begin to tackle these
issues by recruiting research labs from all over the globe to provide
diversity in geographic, linguistic, and researcher representation.
Publications have examined the global understanding of morality, face
processing, COVID-19 information signaling, and more [@dorison2022;
@wang2021; @legate2022; @bago2022; @jones2021; @vanbavel2022]. While
these organizations and one-time groups for BTS studies have provided an
incredible wealth of data for the scientific community, we do not yet
know exactly *who* is involved with, and benefits from, the BTS and
credibility movement. Publications on BTS generally explore challenges,
lessons learned, and the need for BTS [@forscher2020; @coles2022].

Therefore, the goal of this manuscript is to examine the *people*
involved in BTS projects. We specifically expect to examine ICSR's
Research Themes of inclusivity, research careers, and research
globalization. As we examine these themes, it will bring new knowledge
of how BTS projects impact each theme and field of study. We see an
increase in interest and publications in BTS but we do not yet know if
this uptick in large-scale projects has diversified the *people*
involved in BTS. While a few publications have noted that BTS appears to
be early career researchers [@maizey2019], no one has systematically
investigated this perception. Further, it is unclear if the focus of
de-WEIRDing science has only focused on the representation of the
research participants or if it has also improved the representation of
researchers outside of North America and Europe. Last, who runs these
BTS projects? Do we see an increase in diversity for the authors who
generally receive the most credit for these projects (i.e., first
several author(s) and last author)? As hiring and promoting practices
often place a heavy weight on publications and especially "influential"
publications, it becomes necessary to critically examine the
representation present in authorship in BTS projects.

# Potential Outlets

We will aim for high impact broad scope journals such as *Science*,
*Nature* or *Nature Human Behaviour*. Other journals would include
review publications within psychology to compare the social sciences to
other sciences: *Perspectives in Psychological Science*, *Psychological
Bulletin*, *Psychological Review*, or *Current Directions in
Psychological Science*.

# Research Questions

-   Research Question 1: What publication sources publish big team
    science papers?
-   Research Question 2: What are the types of articles that are being
    published in big team science?
-   Research Question 3: Who is involved in big team science?

For each of these research questions, we will examine the overall
results of all big team research projects, and examine for change in
result trends across years of publication. Below we detail our methods
and the ICSR/Scopus data to answer these questions, along with examples
of the statistical results we expect to report in the manuscript. We
began this project with data using Google Scholar and ORCID information.
These sources were severely limited in their scope and breadth, as they
are often curated with automatic processes or self-entered data, and we
believe that access to Scopus and ICSR would allow us to accurately
portray the BTS movement and its impact on diversity across many fields.
The novelty of this project is that it would focus on all of published
works, rather than a specific subfield (like Psychology) and give a lens
into global representation in science that would otherwise not be
achieved with open-source databases.

# Method

## Publications

We have defined **BTS publications** as publications with at least 10
authors at 10 different institutions that were published in
peer-reviewed journals or had posted a full paper pre-print. We will use
data from 1970 and forward in the publications (`ani`) database, as it
is noted online that this time period includes cited references for
calculation of several of our variables described below. We will analyze
our results based on the big four subject areas: Physical Sciences,
Health Sciences, Social Sciences, and Life Sciences. We filtered the database to include articles, articles in press, business articles, conference papers, data papers, preprints, and surveys using Elsevier's classification system. 

## Data Curation

### RQ1: Publisher Information.

Using these criteria, we will extract the following information for
publication sources: the name of the publication (source title), subject
area (both the large four subject areas and the smaller four digit all
science journal classification ASJC codes). We will examine journal
impact using the Source Normalized Impact per Paper from the journal
(`sources`) database.

### RQ2: Publication Information.

For each publication of the identified BTS publications, we will analyze
the full four digit ASJC subject areas codes for each of the larger four
subject areas and the keywords present for these publications.

### RQ3: Author Information.

The author list will then be extracted from each publication. Next, we
will use the author (`au`) and affiliation (`af`) array to curate a list
of all publications and author information included in BTS papers. We
will use these two arrays with the publication array to calculate the
variables described below.

***Career Length***. Career length for each author will be defined as
the year of the first publication listed for each author.

***Institution***. We will use the affiliation ids and country to gather
information about the places of education and/or employment for authors.
Country will likely be binned into United Nation Sub-Region for
analyses.

***Education***. We will also collect degree information from the author
table.

***Types of Publications***. We will gather information from the
publication type variable for each author publication to present
information about the types of papers BTS authors publish.

***Publication Metrics***. For each author, we will calculate the total
number of publications, and the h-index. The h-index represents the highest *h* number of publications that have at least *h* citations.

## Data analysis

### RQ1: Publisher Information.

To present results on this research question, we will analyze:

-   Number of articles for inclusion: total, separated by four subject
    areas, presenting graphics of the number of publication across time
    total

```{r}
total_num <- 13581
health_num <- 10685
physical_num <- 6151
social_num <- 543
life_num <- 7686
```

The total number of articles included in this analysis was `r total_num` including `r health_num` Health Sciences articles, `r physical_num` Physical Sciences articles, `r social_num` Social Sciences articles, and `r life_num` Life Sciences articles. Articles could be classified into multiple categories. 

```{r}
ggplot(DF$pub_time_count %>% 
         filter(SubjectArea != "Multidisciplinary"), aes(Year, count, color = SubjectArea)) + 
  theme_classic() + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral", name = "Subject Area") + 
  ylab("Number of Articles Per Year") + 
  xlab("Publication Year") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
    
-   Number of distinct journals within each of the four subject areas

```{r}
journals <- 2534
health_journal <- 1472
physical_journal <- 641
social_journal <- 206
life_journal <- 1024
```

The number of distinct journals big team science articles were published in was `r journals` with `r health_journal` journals in Health Sciences, `r physical_journal` journals in Physical Sciences, `r social_journal` journals in Social Sciences, and `r life_journal` journals in Life Sciences. The descriptive statistics for the Source Normalized Impact per Paper is presented in Table X. 

```{r results = 'asis', include = TRUE}
flextable(
  DF$snip %>% 
    mutate(M = apa_num(M), 
           SD = apa_num(SD), 
           Minimum = apa_num(Minimum), 
           Median = apa_num(Median), 
           Maximum = apa_num(Maximum))
)
```

### RQ2: Publication Information.

For each publication, we will examine:

-   The totals of the number of articles published within the smaller
    subject area classifications. We will visualize these differences
    over time to determine if there is increasing interest in a specific
    subarea over time for each of the four larger subject area
    classifications.
    
```{r}
#DF$pub_time_subject$ASJC <- factor(DF$pub_time_subject$ASJC)
pub_total <- DF$pub_time_subject %>% 
  group_by(SubjectArea, ASJC) %>% 
  summarize(count = sum(count), .groups = "keep") %>% 
  filter(SubjectArea != "Multidisciplinary")

health_cloud <- wordcloud2(pub_total %>% 
             filter(SubjectArea == "Health Sciences") %>% 
             ungroup() %>% 
             select(ASJC, count)) 

saveWidget(health_cloud, "tmp.html", selfcontained = F)
webshot("tmp.html", "figure/health_cloud.png", vwidth = 600, vheight = 600)

physical_cloud <- wordcloud2(pub_total %>% 
             filter(SubjectArea == "Physical Sciences") %>% 
             ungroup() %>% 
             select(ASJC, count)) 

saveWidget(physical_cloud, "tmp.html", selfcontained = F)
webshot("tmp.html", "figure/physical_cloud.png", vwidth = 600, vheight = 600)

life_cloud <- wordcloud2(pub_total %>% 
             filter(SubjectArea == "Life Sciences") %>% 
             ungroup() %>% 
             select(ASJC, count)) 

saveWidget(life_cloud, "tmp.html", selfcontained = F)
webshot("tmp.html", "figure/life_cloud.png", vwidth = 600, vheight = 600)

social_cloud <- wordcloud2(pub_total %>% 
             filter(SubjectArea == "Social Sciences") %>% 
             ungroup() %>% 
             select(ASJC, count)) 

saveWidget(social_cloud, "tmp.html", selfcontained = F)
webshot("tmp.html", "figure/social_cloud.png", vwidth = 600, vheight = 600)
```

```{r}
h <- fig("figure/health_cloud.png")
p <- fig("figure/physical_cloud.png") 
l <- fig("figure/life_cloud.png") 
s <- fig("figure/social_cloud.png") 



h + ggtitle("Health Sciences") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
p + ggtitle("Physical Sciences") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
l + ggtitle("Life Sciences") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
s + ggtitle("Social Sciences") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  plot_layout(ncol = 2, 
              nrow = 2)
```    

-   The keywords present in the publications data overall to identify
    trends and common themes in the publications for the four subject
    areas using visualizations (wordclouds) to depict the common
    keywords.
    
```{r}
health_cloud <- wordcloud2(DF$keywords %>% 
             filter(SubjectArea == "Health Sciences") %>% 
             ungroup() %>% 
             select(keywords_nostop, count)) 

saveWidget(health_cloud, "tmp.html", selfcontained = F)
webshot("tmp.html", "figure/health_key.png", vwidth = 600, vheight = 600)

physical_cloud <- wordcloud2(DF$keywords %>% 
             filter(SubjectArea == "Physical Sciences") %>% 
             ungroup() %>% 
             select(keywords_nostop, count), 
             minSize = 20) 

saveWidget(physical_cloud, "tmp.html", selfcontained = F)
webshot("tmp.html", "figure/physical_key.png", vwidth = 600, vheight = 600)

life_cloud <- wordcloud2(DF$keywords %>% 
             filter(SubjectArea == "Life Sciences") %>% 
             ungroup() %>% 
             select(keywords_nostop, count)) 

saveWidget(life_cloud, "tmp.html", selfcontained = F)
webshot("tmp.html", "figure/life_key.png", vwidth = 600, vheight = 600)

social_cloud <- wordcloud2(DF$keywords  %>% 
             filter(SubjectArea == "Social Sciences") %>% 
             ungroup() %>% 
             select(keywords_nostop, count)) 

saveWidget(social_cloud, "tmp.html", selfcontained = F)
webshot("tmp.html", "figure/social_key.png", vwidth = 600, vheight = 600)
```

```{r}
h <- fig("figure/health_key.png")
p <- fig("figure/physical_key.png") 
l <- fig("figure/life_key.png") 
s <- fig("figure/social_key.png") 

h + ggtitle("Health Sciences") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
p + ggtitle("Physical Sciences") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
l + ggtitle("Life Sciences") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
s + ggtitle("Social Sciences") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  plot_layout(ncol = 2, 
              nrow = 2)
```

### RQ3: Authors.

We will first present:

-   The total number of unique authors

```{r}
total_authors <- 257536
avg_authors <- apa_num(49.904646)
sd_authors <- apa_num(207.006114)
min_authors <- 10
med_authors <- 19
max_authors <- 5155
```

The total number of unique authors across all publications was `r total_authors`.

-   Statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median) on
    the number of authors included on publications.
    
The mean number of authors per publication was *M* = `r avg_authors` (*SD* = `r sd_authors`, *Med* = `r med_authors`) with a range of `r min_authors` to `r max_authors`. 

-   We will present visualizations of these results across time.

```{r}
avg_author_time <- 
  DF$author_time %>% 
  filter(SubjectArea != "Multidisciplinary") %>% 
  filter(Number_Papers >= 3) %>% 
  mutate(low = (Average_Num_Authors - as.numeric(SD_Num_Authors)), 
         high = (Average_Num_Authors + as.numeric(SD_Num_Authors)))
  
ggplot(avg_author_time, aes(Year, Average_Num_Authors)) + 
  theme_classic() + 
  geom_point(aes(size = Number_Papers)) + 
  #geom_point() + 
  #geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = low, ymax = high)) + 
  facet_wrap(~SubjectArea) + 
  ylab("Average Number of Authors") + 
  xlab("Publication Year") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

We will use the 95% confidence interval to make all claims of predictors or effects different zero. The confidence interval that does not include zero would be considered different from zero (to four decimal places). We make no directional predictions.

***Career Length***.

-   We will create a visualization of the trend and variance of
    researcher career length across publication years.
    
```{r}
ggplot(DF$career_time %>% 
         filter(SubjectArea != "Multidisciplinary"), 
       aes(Year, avg_career, color = sd_career)) +
  theme_classic() + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~SubjectArea) + 
  theme(legend.position = "non") + 
  ylab("Average Career Length") +
  xlab("Year of Publication")
```

-  To analyze trends over time, we will calculate the average career length for each publication (i.e., average the author career length to create one score for each paper) and run a regression analysis using career length to predict year of publication. In order to show variance between individuals, we calculate the standard deviation of career length for each publication and run a regression analysis using this variance representation to predict publication year. These two variables will be used together. 
- Negative slopes would indicate more young scholars in later years (i.e., lower average career length as time increases). Positive slopes would indicate older scholars in later years (i.e., higher average career length as time increases). 
- Negative slopes imply that variability decreases over the years, so the average career length is more homogeneous. Positive slopes imply that variability increases over the years, so the average career length is varied across individuals (lots of different types of scholars). 
-   These analyses will be completed separately for each of the four large subject areas.

***Institution***.

-   We will summarize the number of affiliation ids present in BTS
    publications by subject area and visualize these results across
    time. These visualizations will be presented separately for each of
    the four subject areas.

```{r}
affs <- 35114
```

The total number of unique affiliation across all papers was `r affs`.  

```{r}
ggplot(DF$inst_time %>% 
         filter(SubjectArea != "Multidisciplinary") %>% 
         mutate(Decade = ifelse(Year < 1990, "1980s",

                                       ifelse(Year < 2020, "2010s", "2020s"))))),

***Education***.

We will summarize the general education categories of individuals at the time of publication, along with a summary for change over time.

    Figure out how messy this is for text processing requirements
    For each publication, plot of proportion of doctorates across time - if the number is going down, we are involving more diverse types of people (assuming that doctorates are "normal" academics/researchers)
    We will only perform this analysis if the proportion of information avaliable is over 50%.

***Publication Metrics***.

- We will report descriptive statistics on the total number of publications and h-index for individuals overall.
  - Do this for each unique person and report averages
  - Do this for each publication and create an average for each publication

```{r}
avg_pub_count_author	<- apa_num(4.451816)
std_pub_count_author <- apa_num(6.901369)

avg_pub_count_paper <- apa_num(7.581413)
sd_pub_count_paper <- apa_num(5.797233)
avg_SD_pub_count_paper <- apa_num(7.140015)
SD_SD_pub_count_paper <- apa_num(5.10383)

avg_HIndex <- apa_num(14.242142)
std_HIndex <- apa_num(43.798203)
med_HIndex <- apa_num(2.0)

avg_of_avg_HIndex <- apa_num(28.136255)
std_of_avg_HIndex <- apa_num(38.013819)
avg_of_std_HIndex <- apa_num(36.430509)
std_of_std_HIndex <- apa_num(46.474619)
med_of_med_HIndex <- apa_num(5.0)
```

The average number of publications by authors on big team sciences papers is *M* = `r avg_pub_count_author` (*SD* = `r std_pub_count_author`). The publication counts were averaged across authors for each publication, and then these average publication counts were averaged across publications *M* = `r avg_pub_count_paper` (*SD* = `r sd_pub_count_paper`). The average variability (i.e., the average standard deviation with authors of a manuscript) with publication counts of a paper was $M_{SD}$ = `r avg_SD_pub_count_paper` ($SD_{SD}$ = `r SD_SD_pub_count_paper`). 

The same process was completed with *h*-index for each author and publication. The average *h*-index for authors overall was *M* = `r avg_HIndex` (*SD* = `r std_HIndex`, *Med* = `r med_HIndex`). The average *h*-index for publications was *M* = `r avg_of_avg_HIndex` (*SD* = `r std_of_avg_HIndex`), and the variability of *h*-index across manuscripts was $M_{SD}$ = `r avg_of_std_HIndex` ($SD_{SD}$ = `r std_of_std_HIndex`, $Med_{Med}$ = `r med_of_med_HIndex`).

- Next, we will use the same analyses described in the career length section to analyze trends over time. An increasing slope over time indicates that individuals who are publishing more are more represented in BTS over time (i.e., increasing numbers of scholars with higher publication rates), while a negative slope indicates more researchers with less publications.
- A positive slope for standard deviation indicates increasing variance over time (i.e., more diversity in the individual publication rates), while a negative slope would indicate less diversity in researchers over time. While publication rates do not represent value as a researcher, they are often used in hiring and promotion decisions, and we will use this variable as a proxy to gauge the diversity in scholars represented in big teams.
- We will separate these by each of the four subject areas.

-   To understand the change in representation diversity, we will
    summarize the total number of geopolitical regions for each paper.
    Using a linear model, we will examine if the number of regions
    present is predicted by the year of publication. Increasing
    diversity would be represented by a positive slope, while decreasing
    diversity would be represented by a negative slope.

-   Last, we will examine the differences in representation for
    corresponding author sets versus all other authors. For papers with
    10 to 49 authors, we will use the three first authors and the last
    author to compare against other authors. For 50 to 99 authors, five
    first authors plus last will be used, and for all papers with more
    than 100 authors, we will use ten first authors and the last author.
    We will calculate the frequencies of each of the UN Sub-Regions for
    first authors versus other authors, converting these values to
    proportions. Given the expected small sample sizes of these
    contingency tables, we will group together titles based on the year
    of publication (assuming at least 5 publications per year, these may
    be binned by 5-year or smaller increments to increase sample size).
    For each grouping, we will calculate the effect size of the
    differences in frequencies comparing first authors to all other
    authors. Since this data is categorical, we will use Cramer's *V* to
    represent the effect size. If the effect size includes zero in its
    confidence interval, this result will imply that first and all other
    authors represent the same pattern of UN Sub-Region diversity. Any
    confidence interval that does include zero represents a difference
    in diversity.

end up with a list of effect sizes by year by small medium large 
x axis is year
y axis is the effect size and the confidence interval 
if diversity is increasing then the patterns would be more similar (effect size of zero)
if diversity is not increasing then the patterns would be different (effect size does not include zero)
